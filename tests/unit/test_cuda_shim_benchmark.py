"""Unit coverage for the CUDA shim's autotune surface.

FlagGems' autotuner benchmarks every candidate config before it picks one, and
`LibEntry` resolves that benchmark through triton's replay protocol by default.
Replay means `triton.testing.do_bench_cudagraph`, which captures a
`torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` -- a dummy base class in the CPU torch wheel the CUDA shim
exists for, so the capture raises inside `LibEntry`'s per-config try/except. Each
candidate is then logged as "failed to compile" and timed at `inf`, which floods
the terminal and, silently, leaves autotuning with nothing to select from.

These tests need no GPU: they drive the two decisions -- is graph capture
available, and which benchmarker reaches triton -- with the capability stubbed.
